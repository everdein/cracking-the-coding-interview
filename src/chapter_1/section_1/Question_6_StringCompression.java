// Problem 1.6: String Compression
// Prompt:
// Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. 
// For example, the string "aabcccccaaa" would become "a2b1c5a3". If the compressed string would not 
// become smaller than the original string, your method should return the original string. You can 
// assume the string has only uppercase and lowercase letters (a-z).
